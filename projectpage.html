<h1>Project Details</h1>
<h3>Project Overview</h3>
<p>This project is an asset tracking software, intended for companies and groups to track basic availability and potential maintainance issues with vehicles and equipment through a database that can be customized per piece of equipment, through a database that can be customized per item, as well as display a pass/fail metric for if the equipment is being used, ready for use, or in need of attention.<br><br>Included fields in the project concept are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Availability - Vehicle/equipment up to date on maintenance and not in use</li>
<li>Maintainance Status - Track services, log sheets, vehicle check sheets, etc</li>
<li>Sign in/sign out dates and names for shared equipment</li>
<li>Ability to add forms or field on a per-client basis for customization to suit the needs of each item - Hour meters, odometers, etc.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3>Motivation</h3>
<p>A problem that seems to be fairly common within fleets of equipment or vehicles is an inability to keep track of vehicle and equipment maintenance. Having a centralized and easy to access database would assist small business owners and franchise operators with asset management, ensuring their vehicles meet standards that they can set up within the product. For example, one could set up the database to ensure weekly vehicle checks and regular service requirements are being completed or met, along with knowing at a glance which vehicles are idle, which need tending to, and who was responsible for the vehicle last or currently.</p>
<br>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Features I want to include in this product are fairly simple in concept, though execution may be a different story.</p>
<br>
<h4>Customizable Database</h4>
<p>Equipment does not universally have the same requirements. Vehicles used for transport often need their odometers tracked, though other equipment usually requires hour meters, as an example. Therefore, the database to be used needs to be flexible enough to work with a variety of applications and equipment types to be viable as a solution.</p>
<h4>Accessable Information</h4>
<p>The database needs to be accessible, potentially to multiple supervisors, with the ability of other users to sign in and sign out of equipment or fill out checklists to streamline the usage of the software. This means a variety of devices may need to be able to access the data, and have a similar user experience in terms of quality of life and usage interface.</p>
<h4>Decentralized Storage</h4>
<p>While syncing information is a valuable asset, the real world can lead to problems (especially in remote countryside areas of Australia, for example) with connectivity. Potentially, it could be worth having on device storage with the possibility of syncing later, when the device regains connectivity, to keep the user experience smooth.</p>
<h4>Simple, intuitive interface</h4>
<p>A lot of people won’t want to read manuals to understand the finer nuances of company mandated software. A focus on intuition friendly interface would be the best route to suit the majority of users in this case.</p>
<h4>Overview for Owners/Supervisors</h4>
<p>A customizable view which can be used by management to check on equipment status at a glance. Possibly including different states. A simple version would be “Ready/Not Ready/In Use”, though a more advanced version could share a bit more information, “Ready, Not Ready, In use, maintenance required,” etc.</p>
<h4>Multi-device compatability</h4>
<p>Considering the purpose it would be best to get a good sample of common business tablets and phones to make sure everything works as intended on the majority of devices. (Windows, Apple and android operating systems, mainly.)</p>
<br>
<h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
<p>Software wise using a database software that is already available may be the best starting point. There are a number of open source solutions out there, though noncentralized storage may add additional complexity to the concept. Hardware requirements may be a centralized server, or a storage solution per customer. (Possibly using Raspberry Pi’s or other formats for dedicated hardware solutions in small scale deployments, or dedicated servers or cloud storage for larger ones.) Reviewing a list of options for open source database solutions (A geekflare article specifically), one that could be especially suitable given the possibility of non-constant connectivity (country areas, etc) is <a href="https://couchdb.apache.org/">CouchDB</a>) for an ability to make sure databases can sync. The drawbacks also listed in the same article are it using much more storage than other solutions, as well as a slower write speed. <a href="https://geekflare.com/open-source-database/"/>Link to the original article here</a></p>
<br>
<h3>Skills Required</h3>
<p>Skills required for this project include database construction and management, familiarity with database software to the point of being able to choose a suitable database for all points of design intended. Some hardware familiarity is also likely to be needed to create walkthroughs as well as testing on likely devices that the software may be used on.
Using the second-hand market may be a viable way to get testing devices, and building skills for database software depends on free time to study online sources for me. It would also likely be a good plan to get a hold of some Raspberry Pi machines to get familiarity with that kind of hardware.</p>
<br>
<h3>Outcome</h3>
<p>If the project is successful, the outcome would be a purpose designed maintenance check database to help fleet or equipment centric businesses manage their assets in an easy to digest manner.
This solves the problem of being unable to keep track of multiple different things about each asset by resolving it into one place, with those using the database able to see at a glance what is available, what is in use, and what requires attention (or will require attention soon).
Thus, the impact, if it is successful, will be a simplified, streamlined experience for those needing to keep track of a variety of vehicles or assets, rather than having to worry about each vehicle or piece of equipment’s needs separately, while also increasing employee or customer safety by ensuring maintenance is completed on time.</p>
