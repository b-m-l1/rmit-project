<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
<h3>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).</h3>
<p>My interest in IT started in high school - Primarily through some work experience with a local manufacturing company. I didn’t really follow it up originally, as I found my first full time job and focused on that. <br>Thus, my experience in the area is a little bit sparse - I have some knowledge of taking things apart and putting them together, and some very basic knowledge of what parts are within a physical desktop.</p>
<h3>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h3>
<p>I enquired with Open Universities Australia about IT education. Fortunately for me, it was at the right time to sign up for a course plan. I’d love to say it was well planned and plotted out, however the truth is it was really just good timing to make an enquiry to OUA.</p>
<h3>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h3>
<p>I expect to learn a whole lot about IT that I had little to no knowledge of before. Even during the introduction sections of this course I’ve come to realize that there’s a lot more involvement of IT in both future and current technology, and touching on some of how it’s developing.</p>
