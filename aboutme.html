<p>Hi, I'm Benjamin, though I prefer Ben. I'm originally born in Australia, though I spent six years growing up in england.</p>
<h3>Education</h3>
<p>Education-wise I've got a few certifications, including a Cert III in Logisitics and a Cert II in Public Safety through the NSW State Emergency Service.</p>
<h3>Hobbies</h3>
<p>I've had a number of hobbies over the years, though my volunteer work in the community has been the primary one lately. It's certainly been both interesting and challenging through the bush fires, floods, storms and Covid of the past few years.<br>Otherwise, my primary interest is video games, with a growing interest in camping that I hope to indulge in coming years, along with potentially building myself a gaming computer, once I can gather the funds to do so.</p>
