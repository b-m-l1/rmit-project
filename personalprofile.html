<h3>What do these test results mean for me?</h3>
<p>These results seem, in my opinion, fairly accurate to how I feel I’ve assessed myself. I’ve been aware of having a more introverted personality type, along with, especially lately, a bit of a streak of anxiety and being unsure of myself due to a mix of factors.</p>
<h3>How do you think these results may influence your behavior in a team?</h3>
<p>I try to be as open and free in terms of teamwork as possible. I’m aware that I’m introverted, and like to use it to keep myself aware that others are part of the team, using it to keep lines of communication open. The results seem to mostly back that up, though perhaps I should work on my anxieties some.</p>
<h3>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h3>
<p>It’s always a good idea to take personalities into account when forming a team, clashing personalities can result in very poor performance, however, finding meshing team members can make for a very effective and well performing team, as strengths combine to cover weaknesses of the individual members.</p>
